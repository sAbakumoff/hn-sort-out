We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after four years, almost half of all schools in the US (64,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.We’re a team of 120 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.

It doesn't matter whether your resumé says PHP or PhD: if you're smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.We have many established offices worldwide (pivotal.io/locations) and more coming.We're broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, that Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&D and Big Data.-- Pivotal Labs helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.-- Cloud R&D is where we build the best cloud platform available. We're the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product ever and it's still zooming up and to the right.Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD'd. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.-- Big Data is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum's distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.-- GenerallyAt our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay.

NYGC's partnerships with nearby top-tier hospitals in Manhattan enable unique human analysis studies. We have both junior and senior software engineering positions available. The group is a mixed local/remote team, but all of the currently open positions are ONSITE. Our interview process is phone conversation followed by onsite interview.NYGC is not a software company; it is a sequencing lab trying to push science at scale, and needs software to do so. We have gone from zero to top-three in five years, and we are hungry to become the leader. We're aggressively scaling our clinical services, so if you have even the smallest allergy to documentation or process, please stop reading now.These positions are for the automation group, which currently has ten people. NYGC is graduating from successful startup to a medium-sized company. In software, we're replacing duct tape with small applications, and introducing larger applications to help people with scale. We also introduce duct tape to make impossible things happen. People who join NYGC software are expected to learn quickly, be self-motivated, and be comfortable switching tracks. You don't have to understand e.g. genome sequence alignment, but you do have to be able to read a manual on a tool's use and learn enough vocabulary to have an intelligent conversation with an expert on the subject.This group uses python and postgresql, adding minimal javascript when making frontend applications. We are intentionally boring (https://valdhaus.co/writings/boring-systems/) in our technology choices because our goal is data analysis, not novel software work. We design everything for reliability, maintenance, low cost of ownership, and failure recovery. It is a combination of boring technology and fast pace: we are the computational pipeline team, the automation team, the LIMS team, the database team, the data transport team (surprisingly fun at >20PB), the customer delivery team, the JIRA team. We don't do genomic methods software (e.g. better variant calling) -- we have a great computational biology group for that. Our team is not Agile, but our business is. We make it all run at scale, on our local cluster of >6k cores.

On the database side, we use Redis to coordinate services and Postgres for our primary data store.
